# SIR_Model_Covid
Project coded in Python notebook for Econom√≠a Matematica I course at the Univerisdad de Montevideo.
Language: Spanish.<br>

Object of the project was to analyse the evolution of COVID 19 in Uruguay and the posible future outcomes based on diferente variations of the SIR parameters.<br>
- We look deeply into this parameters and how there changes impact the outcomes.
- We explain in depth what is the intuition behind this parameters.
- We input the maximum amount of IR beds available at the time in Uruguay, and given a set of parameters, we look if the hospitals would be saturated.
- In the last section of the code, we add a twist to the SIR model, by adding vaccines. This moves individuals between the Suceptible group and the Cured group, reducing the spread of the virus. We conclude that given this parameters, a vaccination campaing of 0.01% of the population would reduce 140000 contagious cases.
